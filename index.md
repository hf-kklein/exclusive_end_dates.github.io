# End Dates Shuold be Exclusive: Here's why

When modelling time periods/frames/slices/ranges their end should always be exclusive. This page collects good reasons for this convention.

## What are you talking about?

If you have a time frame, it is usually defined by a start and an end datetime. If your time frame starts at January 1st, then

```
start = 2021-01-01
```

Inclusive start dates are common sense.
If the time frame ends at the end of January, then the end date should be

```
end = 2021-02-01
```

That the end date, the first moment in February, is not inside the time frame ("January") is refered to as "_exclusive_ end date".

The opposite is an inclusive end date (e.g `end=2021-01-31`). But this comes with a lot of problems.

## Convenience

It's just convenient to use exclusive end dates:

```
length_of_time_frame = end-start
```
