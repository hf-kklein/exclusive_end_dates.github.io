# End Dates Shuold be Exclusive: Here's why

When modelling time periods/frames/slices/ranges their end should always be exclusive. This page collects good reasons for this convention.

## What are you talking about?

If you have a time frame, it is usually defined by a start and an end datetime. If your time frame starts at January 1st, then

```
start = 2021-01-01
```

Inclusive start dates are common sense.
If the time frame ends at the end of January, then the end date should be

```
end = 2021-02-01
```

That the end date, the first moment in February, is not inside the time frame ("January") is refered to as "_exclusive_ end date".

The opposite is an inclusive end date (e.g `end=2021-01-31`). But this comes with a lot of problems.

## Convenience and Conventions

It's just convenient to use exclusive end dates:

```
length_of_time_frame = end-start
```

| Convention               | Exclusive Result                      | Naive Inclusive Result                | Inclusive Workaround            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `duration = end - start` | `2021-02-01 - 2021-01-31 = 31 days`‚úîÔ∏è | `2021-01-31 - 2021-01-01 = 30 days`‚ùå | `duration = end - start + ??`üòí |

Adding or substracting single days, seconds or ticks, when all you want is just the duration of a time slice is not convenient.

Basically all programming languages follow this convention:

### Python

```python
from datetime import date

start = date(2021, 1, 1)
end = date(2021, 2, 1)
duration = end - start
print(f"The time between {start} and {end} is {duration.days} days")
# The time between 2021-01-01 and 2021-02-01 is 31 days
```

(_Pandas allows [to specify](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.date_range.html) if `date_range` start and end are open/exclusive or closed/inclusive._)

### C#

```c#
var start = new DateTime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
var end = new DateTime(2021, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
var duration = end-start;
Console.Out.WriteLine($"The time between {start:O} and {end:O} is {duration.TotalDays} days");
// The time between 2021-01-01T00:00:00.0000000Z and 2021-02-01T00:00:00.0000000Z is 31 days
```

### Go

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Date(2021, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
	end := time.Date(2021, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
	fmt.Printf("The time between %v and %v is %v days", start, end, end.Sub(start).Hours()/24)
}
```
